# SALES-PERFORMANCE-DASHBOARD
## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project focuses on Sales Performance Analysis of furniture company.A sales performance dashboard was created to evaluate key business metrics such as sales, profit, quantity sold, and delivery performance. The analysis provides a clear view of how the company is performing across different states and cities and supports data-driven decision-making.

# 📌Problem Statement
Many companies struggle to identify which regions generate the most revenue, what factors affect profitability, and how operational processes such as delivery and shipping impact performance. In some cases, revenue may increase while profit margins decline due to inefficiencies that go unnoticed. This project aims to address these challenges by providing clear insights into sales, profit trends, and delivery performance.

# Project Objectives
The key objectives of this project are to:
- Generate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, total profit, quantity sold, and average delivery days
- Analyze year-over-year performance to evaluate growth or decline
- Assess sales performance by state and city
- Identify the most frequently used shipping method
- Uncover actionable insights to support strategic business decisions

# ✂️Tools Used
  - Microsoft Excel
  - Power Query
 
 # 🪥 Data Cleaning and Preparation
The data was cleaned and prepared using Power Query. Unnecessary columns were removed, data types were standardized, and duplicates were handled. Additional features such as delivery days and monthly periods were derived to support time-based and performance analysis.

# 💡Key Insights
- Regional Sales Performance
New York City recorded the highest sales among all cities, while California emerged as the top-performing state overall. These regions contribute a significant share of total revenue, indicating strong market demand and customer concentration in these locations.

- Shipping Method Usage
Standard shipping is the most frequently used shipping method across all orders, suggesting that customers prioritize affordability and acceptable delivery timelines over faster but more expensive options.

- Product Sub-Category Performance
Chairs are the most sold sub-category within the furniture product line, indicating consistently high demand compared to other furniture items.

- Monthly Sales Trends
Sales trends fluctuate throughout the year rather than following a linear pattern. December records the highest sales volume, highlighting strong seasonal demand toward the end of the year.

- Year-over-Year Performance
Year-over-year analysis shows an overall increase in sales and total profit; however, there is a noticeable decline in profit percentage. This indicates that while revenue is growing, profit margins may be under pressure.

- Delivery Performance
The average delivery time across all regions is approximately 4 days, reflecting generally efficient delivery operations, though delivery duration varies slightly by location.


# 📌Recommendations 

- Strengthen High-Performing Regions
Focus marketing campaigns, inventory availability, and customer retention strategies in top-performing regions such as New York City and California to maximize revenue growth.

- Optimize Shipping Strategy
Since standard shipping is the most preferred method, efforts should be made to further optimize its efficiency and cost structure to maintain customer satisfaction while reducing logistics expenses.

- Capitalize on High-Demand Products
Increase inventory levels and promotional efforts for chairs, as this sub-category demonstrates strong and consistent demand. Expanding product variations in this category may further boost sales.

- Plan for Seasonal Demand
Prepare for peak sales in December by increasing stock levels, improving supply chain readiness, and launching targeted marketing campaigns ahead of the holiday season.

- Monitor Profit Margins Closely
Investigate factors contributing to declining profit margins despite increased sales, such as excessive discounting or rising operational costs, and adjust pricing or cost-control strategies accordingly.

- Maintain and Improve Delivery Efficiency
While average delivery time is acceptable, regions with longer delivery durations should be reviewed to identify opportunities for logistics improvements and better customer experience.
